# Universal planner for Arknights

Includes three main functions:
- Gacha planner (`gacha-planner.ipynb`)
- Operator build planner (`arknights-operator-planner.ipynb`)
- Calculate value of materials and which stages are worth farming (`arknights-mats-calc.ipynb`)

Material calculations using methods outlined by [Moe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12X0uBQaN7MuuMWWDTiUjIni_MOP015GnulggmBJgBaQ/edit#gid=485742288).

I really just did it because I can.
It's probably not worth other people using., but you can always try.
